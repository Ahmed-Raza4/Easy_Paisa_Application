# Ahmed's Easy Paisa App

Hey there! I'm Ahmed Raza and I'm diving into TypeScript. Right now, I'm working on building a TypeScript clone of the Easy Paisa application. It's a CLI (Command Line Interface) application packed with a variety of functions including easy load, money transfer, balance checking, bill payments, and more.

## How to Use

To give my application a try, simply run the following command in your command line interface:

```
npx ahmed_easy_paisa_app
```

Feel free to explore the features and let me know what you think!
